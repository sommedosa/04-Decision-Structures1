# Decision Structures and Boolean Logic #1

## Decision structures, including:
* Single alternative decision structures: provides only one alternative path of execution
  - If condition is not true, exit the structure
* Dual alternative decision structures: two possible paths of execution
  - One is taken if the condition is true, and the other if the condition is false
* Nested decision structures: a decision structure can be nested inside another decision structure

### The if Statement
* Control structure: logical design that controls order in which set of statements execute
* Sequence structure: set of statements that execute in the order they appear
* Decision structure: specific action(s) performed only if a condition exists

### Boolean Expressions and Relational Operators
* Boolean expression: expression tested by if statement to determine if it is true or false
* Relational operator: determines whether a specific relationship exists between two values

### Comparing Strings
Strings can be compared using the == and != operators
String comparisons are case sensitive
Strings can be compared using >, <, >=, and <=
Compared character by character based on the ASCII values for each character
If shorter word is substring of longer word, longer word is greater than shorter word

## Exercise 4

1. A __________ structure can execute a set of statements only under certain circumstances.

	a. sequence

	b. circumstantial

	c. decision

	d. Boolean

2. A(n) __________ expression has a value of either True or False.

	a. binary

	b. decision

	c. unconditional

	d. Boolean

3. A(n) _________ structure tests a condition and then takes one path if the condition is true, or another path if the condition is false.

	a. if statement

	b. single alternative decision

	c. dual alternative decision

	d. sequence

4. You use a(n) __________ statement to write a single alternative decision structure.

	a. test-jump

	b. if

	c. if-else

	d. if-call

5. You use a(n) __________ statement to write a dual alternative decision structure.

	a. test-jump

	b. if

	c. if-else

	d. if-call

6. A compound Boolean expression created with the __________ operator is true only if both of its subexpressions are true.

	a. and

	b. or

	c. not

	d. both

7. A compound Boolean expression created with the _________ operator is true if either of its subexpressions is true.

	a. and

	b. or

	c. not

	d. either

8. The ___________ operator takes a Boolean expression as its operand and reverses its logical value.

	a. and

	b. or

	c. not

	d. either

**True or False**

1. A single alternative decision structure tests a condition and then takes one path if the condition is true, or another path if the condition is false.

2. A decision structure can be nested inside another decision structure.

3. A compound Boolean expression created with the and operator is true only when both subexpressions are true.

4. 9W <> "9w"

5. 'Harry' > 'Mine'

6. '1' < 'one'

7. "Duck" < "Duck" + "Duck"

8. "ty" in "Python"


</br> </br>
**True or False**

Assume the value of a is 1 and the value of b is 1.5, and determine whether the condition evaluates to True or False.

1. a ** (5 – 2) > 7

2. (a < b) or (b < a)

3. (a * a < b) or not(a * a < a)

4. not((a < b) and (a < (b + a)))

5. not(a < b) or not (a < (b + a))

6. ((a == b) and (a * a < b * b)) or ((b < a) and (2 * a < b))

7. ((a == b) or not (b < a)) and ((a < b) or (b == a + 1))

8. 3 * a == 2 * b 

9. b <= 3

10. a ** b == b ** a

11. ((5 – a) * b) < 7

</br> </br>
**Short Answer**

1. Explain how a single alternative decision structure and a dual alternative decision structure differ.

2. Briefly describe how the and operator works.

3. Briefly describe how the or operator works
