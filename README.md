**Exercise 4**

1. A __________ structure can execute a set of statements only under certain circumstances.

	a. sequence

	b. circumstantial

	c. decision

	d. Boolean

2. A(n) __________ expression has a value of either True or False.

	a. binary

	b. decision

	c. unconditional

	d. Boolean

3. A(n) _________ structure tests a condition and then takes one path if the condition is true, or another path if the condition is false.

	a. if statement

	b. single alternative decision

	c. dual alternative decision

	d. sequence

4. You use a(n) __________ statement to write a single alternative decision structure.

	a. test-jump

	b. if

	c. if-else

	d. if-call

5. You use a(n) __________ statement to write a dual alternative decision structure.

	a. test-jump

	b. if

	c. if-else

	d. if-call

6. A compound Boolean expression created with the __________ operator is true only if both of its subexpressions are true.

	a. and

	b. or

	c. not

	d. both

7. A compound Boolean expression created with the _________ operator is true if either of its subexpressions is true.

	a. and

	b. or

	c. not

	d. either

8. The ___________ operator takes a Boolean expression as its operand and reverses its logical value.

	a. and

	b. or

	c. not

	d. either



**True or False**

1. A single alternative decision structure tests a condition and then takes one path if the condition is true, or another path if the condition is false.

2. A decision structure can be nested inside another decision structure.

3. A compound Boolean expression created with the and operator is true only when both subexpressions are true.

4. 9W <> "9w"

5. 'Harry' > 'Mine'

6. '1' < 'one'

7. "Duck" < "Duck" + "Duck"

8. "ty" in "Python"



**True or False**

Assume the value of a is 1 and the value of b is 1.5, and determine whether the condition evaluates to True or False.

1. a ** (5 – 2) > 7

2. (a < b) or (b < a)

3. (a * a < b) or not(a * a < a)

4. not((a < b) and (a < (b + a)))

5. not(a < b) or not (a < (b + a))

6. ((a == b) and (a * a < b * b)) or ((b < a) and (2 * a < b))

7. ((a == b) or not (b < a)) and ((a < b) or (b == a + 1))

8. 3 * a == 2 * b 

9. b <= 3

10. a ** b == b ** a

11. ((5 – a) * b) < 7


**Short Answer**

1. Explain how a single alternative decision structure and a dual alternative decision structure differ.

2. Briefly describe how the and operator works.

3. Briefly describe how the or operator works
